## Technologies used
  This website was created using the following technologies:

# Features
- Responsive (mobile first)
- Fixed top navigation bar

# Features Left to Implement

- The adoption section needed more styling as I would have wanted to make the pictures fill out  all the blank spaces and the result image to scale to the existing available space.
